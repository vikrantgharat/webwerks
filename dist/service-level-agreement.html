                  </ul>

                  <p> The Client may terminate the agreement for breach of terms if WEB WERKS:  </p>

                  <ul class="list-style-single">
                    <li> Fails to provision and deliver the services as promised.  </li>

                   WEB WERKS may decide to suspend the services provided to a customer without liability in the event where  </p>

                  <ul class="list-style-single">
                    <li> WEB WERKS has reasons to believe that the services provided have been used in the past, or are being used at present, or may be used in the future, in violation of the Agreement,  </li>
                    <li> The client is associated with person(s) who have indulged in similar abusive behaviour in the past,  </li>

                  <p> WEB WERKS will exercise all possible efforts to issue a reasonable advance notice to the customer informing them about the suspension of services, under this clause, and also issue a possible remedy, if applicable, unless it is determined in reasonable judgment that the order of suspension is irrevocable and absolutely unavoidable.  </p>

                  <p><strong>1.17. Credit limitations</strong><br>
                   A) The minimum period as mentioned above, of Failure that will qualify for Service Credit is 60 minutes, any period shorter than that will not be aggregated. In case of multiple periods of Failure occurring at the same time or overlapping, Customer will qualify for the longest period of failure to receive Credit. WEB WERKS is not bound to issue multiple credits for one incident, if that one incident qualifies for credits pertaining to multiple parts of this SLA. During such an event, WEB WERKS reserves the rights to decide the credits that may be awarded. Also, the maximum credit that may be issued during a calendar year is equivalent to double the average monthly Service fees over prevailing 12 months. This clause covers Credits that qualify for all Service features and are not related to the length of the failure or the number of times it has occurred.  </p>

                  <p> B) In case the Service credits for a particular year exceed 25% of WEB WERKS' revenues arising out of such period, WEB WERKS holds the right to pro-rate the amount of credits that may be given out to the Customers so that they do not exceed the 25% limit. Please note that WEB WERKS' revenues refer to the Services provided by WEB WERKS brand and does not include revenues from WEB WERKS' any other business unit operating under a different name and providing services that differ from WEB WERKS' services. WEB WERKS has its own internal accounting procedures to compute the revenues and is not liable to disclose its financial information to Customers or third party for this purpose.  </p>

                <p> C) All the Service Credits that have been covered by this SLA will apply only to services rendered in future and do not qualify for credits that may arise out of service delivery in the past. In case a Customer has retained some amount of Service Credit after discontinuing WEB WERKS' Services, such amount will be forfeited. This Credit amount cannot be used against any Service provided by WEB WERKS in future or cannot be used in lieu of professional fees or any amount, whatsoever  </p>

                <p> D) This SLA does not qualify the following for Service Credit:  </p>

                </ul>

                <p> Emergency Maintenance refers to actions that are intended to correct conditions that may cause service failures, and will be decided by WEB WERKS in its sole discretion. WEB WERKS will exercise all possible efforts to restore the Services as soon as possible and will also try and inform the Customers well in advance about the same. But WEB WERKS does not guarantee issuing such a notice and hence the failure to send out these notifications does not amount to Service Failure.  </p>

                <p><strong>1.18. Dispute resolution and arbitration</strong><br>
                 In the-event of a dispute between the parties, the dispute should first be raised to the other party's representative and discussed between the two representatives. Please note as mentioned below, the time frame for dispute resolution:  </p>
